## Coding Standards
- Use ES Modules in the backend (import/export).
- Maintain a clean separation between frontend and backend.
- Ensure type safety using Zod in the frontend.
- Follow a consistent naming convention.
- Keep components small and reusable.
- Use Tailwind for responsive design.

## Development Environment
- Backend runs on port 3001.
- Frontend runs on port 3000.
- Redis runs on port 6379 in a Docker container.
- Environment variables are managed via `.env` files (excluded from Git).

## Rules
- Always use the current project structure: `frontend/` and `backend/` at the root.
- Do not add new features without considering localization (i18n).
- Maintain the `LICENSE` file as provided (personal/educational use only).
